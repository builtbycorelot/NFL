# Visuals

This directory is intended to store screenshots of the **NFL Graph IR Viewer**. The images provide quick references showing how the graph renders in a browser.

No screenshots are checked into the repository at the moment. You can view a hosted version of the viewer on [GitHub Pages](https://builtbycorelot.github.io/NFL) or generate your own screenshots as described below.

## Regenerating screenshots

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser (or use the hosted link above).
2. Interact with the graph viewer until it shows the desired state.
3. Use your operating system's screenshot tool to capture the viewer region.
4. Save the file in this `visuals/` directory with a descriptive name, e.g. `viewer-demo.png`.

If screenshots are added to the repo in the future, place them alongside this README.
