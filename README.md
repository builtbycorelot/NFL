## Vision

 (JSON‑LD, OWL, GeoJSON) while preserving meaning. The `SemanticLedger` tracks provenance and resources.
 
## Live Visuals

* [Launch Page](index.html) – repository overview and links
* [Graph IR Viewer](visualizer.html) – loads `index.nfl.json` automatically.
* [Context](docs/context.md) – repository anchor and semantic index.
