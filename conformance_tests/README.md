# NGL Conformance Tests

This directory contains a minimal conformance test suite skeleton for the Node Graph Language (NGL) Specification v1.1.0. It provides placeholders for parsing, validation, execution, persistence and security tests using `pytest`.

To run the tests locally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest
```

This is a simplified subset of the full test suite described in the specification.
