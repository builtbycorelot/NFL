## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please report suspected security vulnerabilities by emailing [security@corelot.net](mailto:security@corelot.net). Include a description of the issue and any steps required to reproduce it. We request that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability before we have responded.

We aim to respond to all security reports within **five business days**. After triage we will provide an estimated timeline for a fix and keep you informed of progress.
